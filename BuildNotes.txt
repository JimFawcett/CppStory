Build Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. All projects need to be compiled with the C++17 option
   - Right-click on project > select Properties > General Properties 
       > C++ Language Standard > ISO C++17 Standard (std:c++17)
   - Unfortunately you have to do that every time you create a project.
     There is no way, in Visual Studio, to make that the default.
   - I've set that property, so you shouldn't have to do that. But,
     if a project fails to compile, you will  need to reset this
     option.
2. All of these 49 projects are demonstrations, not intended to be
   reusable parts, so they are structured in simple ways.
3. There are warnings for reinterpret casts I've used just to show
   pointer values in long integer format, a legitimet use.
4. There are also a few warnings about unnamed objects with ...
   This happens because I have used default arguments with types
   that are some times used as temporary arguments to functions,
   e.g., fun(X());
5. I've elected not to turn off those warnings with pragmas.
